In simple words dp is an optimal form of recursion.

## Where to use? 

1. Optimal substructure
2. Ovelapping subrpoblems

## Approaches to solve dp problems

First is recursion from where it all begins.Then to optimize this approach dp was introduced we can differentiate dp in two approach

1. Top-down approach (Recursion + Memoization)
2. Bottom-Up approach (Dynamic Programming)

In this repository you will find both of the approaches.
